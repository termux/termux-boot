<p>The Termux:Boot add-on provides functionality to run programs under Termux when the device boots up.

<h2>Usage</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Start the Termux:Boot app once to allow the system to start the app at boot time.
	<li>Create the ~/.termux/boot/ directory.
	<li>Put scripts you want to execute inside the ~/.termux/boot/ directory.
	<li>If there are multiple files, they will be executed in a sorted order.
	<li>Note that you may want to run termux-wake-lock as first thing if you want to ensure that the device is prevented from sleeping.
</ul>

<h2>Example</h2>
<p>To start an sshd server and prevent the device from sleeping at boot, create a file at ~/.termux/boot/start-sshd containing the three lines</p>

<pre>
    #!/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin/sh
    termux-wake-lock
    sshd
</pre>
